# Honesty
Honestly I don't expect/want any contributors, but this seemed like the best standard file to note coding standards.

# Functions
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv)
{
    // code
}
```

# Flow Control
```c
for (int i=0; i<big; i++) {
    // stuff and things
}
```

# Exiting
- `return` for expected function exit
- `exit( RELEVANT_ERROR_CODE )` for error exit
